The libmrhab library offers support for developing applications using a module 
based structure. Modules are implemented by the application, which are then 
updated with recieved events by using a callback based design.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
application development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user application service as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrhab source.
